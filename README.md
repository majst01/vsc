# vscode-go in a container

Clone this repository, `build.sh` it and use `vsc` to start VisualStudio from 
command line.

Note: the current working directory will be treated as the first part of the
`GOPATH` so you will create a `bin` and a `src` subdirectory. 

Work in progress ... don't use it for daily work!
